# Enemy Weapon System Setup Guide

This guide explains how to set up enemies with the new weapon system that uses WeaponData.

## 1. Setup Enemy Prefab

1. Select your Enemy prefab or create a new one
2. Add the `EnemyEquipment` component to your enemy GameObject
3. Set the `Enemy Sprite Renderer` field to the SpriteRenderer component on your enemy
4. Create or assign a `Default Weapon Data` asset to the enemy
   - This is the weapon the enemy will spawn with
   - You can use an existing WeaponData or create a new one specifically for enemies

## 2. Create Enemy Weapon Data Assets

Create weapon data assets for your enemies to use:

1. Right-click in Project window → Create → Game → Weapon Data
2. Configure the weapon data as follows:
   - Set `Weapon Name` (e.g., "Enemy Pistol")
   - Add a `Player Sprite` that represents how the enemy looks with this weapon
   - Set `Pickup Prefab` if you want enemies to drop this weapon when they die
   - Configure shooting properties (spread, fire rate, etc.)
   - Set `Projectile Prefab` to the bullet prefab for this weapon
   - Adjust bullet offset values to match the enemy sprite

## 3. Enemy Weapon Variants

To create enemies with different weapons:

1. Duplicate your base enemy prefab
2. Select the duplicated prefab
3. In the EnemyEquipment component, change the Default Weapon Data to a different weapon

## 4. Important Notes

- Enemies will now use all features from WeaponData including:
  - Different projectiles
  - Different bullet speeds
  - Spread and accuracy settings
  - Shotgun functionality (pellet count)
  - Damage range limitations

- Weapons can be dropped when enemies die (40% chance by default)
- Players can pick up weapons dropped by enemies
- Ensure all enemy weapon sprites (in WeaponData) are properly configured

## 5. Example Setup

Example enemy with a shotgun:
- Create WeaponData asset "EnemyShotgun"
- Set pelletCount to 5, spreadAngle to 30
- Set a distinct sprite that shows the enemy holding a shotgun
- Configure bulletOffset to match where the muzzle appears on the sprite
- Assign to an enemy prefab's EnemyEquipment component

## 6. Troubleshooting

- If enemies are not shooting: Make sure the WeaponData has canShoot = true and a valid projectile prefab
- If enemy sprites don't change: Check that the WeaponData has valid playerSprite values
- If weapon drops don't work: Verify the WeaponData has a valid pickupPrefab assigned
